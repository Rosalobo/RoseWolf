We're Moving!

Oakland, Ca here we come! A new adventure, mild weather, good (& cheap) food, and close proximity to good friends are a few things alluring us across the country.  After a short stint in DC, I'm really looking forward to stay put for awhile and make Oakland home.

Here are a few pics from our trip last week:

Morgan in front of our place in Oakland.  Searching for a place with two large dogs isn't easy, so we were pumped when we found this place.  It not only has with a yard for the pups (with a fruit-filled avocado tree!), but also studio/work space for us.

      <h2 id="summer-recap">Summer Recap</h2>
<p>This summer was filled with travel, family, a wedding, an ordinations, cabin construction, and an arts festival. Since leaving my full-time job in November, I&#39;ve had a lot of time to reflect on the people and things that mean the most to me.  This summer was the culmination of them.  I knew it would be the last time for awhile that I would so much flexibility with my schedule, so why not make the most of it.    </p>

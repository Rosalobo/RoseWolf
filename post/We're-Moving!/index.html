<p>Oakland, Ca here we come! A new adventure, mild weather, good (&amp; cheap) food, and close proximity to good friends are a few things alluring us across the country.  After a short stint in DC, I&#39;m really looking forward to stay put for awhile and make Oakland home.</p>
<p>Here are a few pics from our trip last week:</p>

<p>Morgan in front of our place in Oakland.  Searching for a place with two large dogs isn&#39;t easy, so we were pumped when we found this place.  It not only has with a yard for the pups (with a fruit-filled avocado tree!), but also studio/work space for us. </p>
